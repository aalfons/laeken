\usage{
calibWeights(X, d, totals, q = NULL, method = c("raking", "linear",
  "logit"), bounds = c(0, 10), maxit = 500, tol = 1e-06,
  eps = .Machine$double.eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of binary calibration variables (see
\code{\link{calibVars}}).}

\item{d}{a numeric vector giving the initial sample weights.}

\item{totals}{a numeric vector of population totals corresponding to the
calibration variables in \code{X}.}

\item{q}{a numeric vector of positive values accounting for
heteroscedasticity.  Small values reduce the variation of the
\emph{g}-weights.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the calibration method to be
used.  Possible values are \code{"linear"} for the linear method,
\code{"raking"} for the multiplicative method known as raking and
\code{"logit"} for the logit method.}

\item{bounds}{a numeric vector of length two giving bounds for the g-weights
to be used in the logit method.  The first value gives the lower bound (which
must be smaller than or equal to 1) and the second value gives the upper
bound (which must be larger than or equal to 1).}

\item{maxit}{a numeric value giving the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{tol}{the desired accuracy for the iterative procedure.}

\item{eps}{the desired accuracy for computing the Moore-Penrose generalized
inverse (see \code{\link[MASS]{ginv}}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the \emph{g}-weights.
}
\description{
Calibrate sample weights according to known marginal population totals.
Based on initial sample weights, the so-called \emph{g}-weights are computed
by generalized raking procedures.
}
\details{
The final sample weights need to be computed by multiplying the resulting
\emph{g}-weights with the initial sample weights.
}
\note{
This is a faster implementation of parts of
\code{\link[sampling]{calib}} from package \code{sampling}.  Note that the
default calibration method is raking and that the truncated linear method is
not yet implemented.

\examples{
data(eusilc)
# construct auxiliary 0/1 variables for genders
aux <- calibVars(eusilc$rb090)
# population totals
totals <- c(3990798, 4191431)
# compute g-weights
g <- calibWeights(aux, eusilc$rb050, totals)
# compute final weights
weights <- g * eusilc$rb050
